## About

So... [StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/download/) says _"Sorry, StepMania does not currently run on macOS 10.15 "Catalina" or higher. We don't know when this can be fixed."_ 👀🤔🧐💭💡

🤯 **D/DR** is a minimal StepMania clone that is meant to be a MVP display-only on screen, and not meant to be interactive. In other words, it is a glorified `.ssc|.sm` file-to-display converter. Still can be used for practice and/or great fun though 🙃!

🚧 Obviously WIP 🚧. Some things are not working yet, and these may or may not eventually be supported, depending on how much motivation I can muster 😬:
- Parsing songs that have varying BPMs
- Parsing songs that have stops
- Parsing songs that have non 4-4 time signatures
- Capability to change arrow speed
- Capability to change song speed

## Usage ⚙️
- `Space` or `Return` to start the song (after song selection)
- `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to adjust song sync (-10ms, -1ms, +1ms, +10ms respectively)
- `q` to quit a song early

## Demo 🎬
