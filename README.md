[StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/download/): _"Sorry, StepMania does not currently run on macOS 10.15 "Catalina" or higher. We don't know when this can be fixed."_ -> Let's just make another version because why not? ðŸ™ƒ

Meant to be display-only on screen, and not meant to be interactive; i.e. a `.ssc`-to-display software.

WIP.
